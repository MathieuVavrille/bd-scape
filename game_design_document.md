## Introduction

### Game summary pitch

BD-Scape is a story/puzzle game where you can influence the book you are reading by picking objects and using them inside the book.

### Inspiration

#### Myst

Myst makes you solve puzzle by interacting with your environment. You pick objects and gather clues that will help you advance in other parts of the game.

#### The Stanley Parable

The Stanley Parable has multiple endings that depend on the actions you decide to perform.

#### Escape Books

Escape books give the player a way to get involved in a story by making actions.

#### Groundhog Day

Similar to Rogue-like/lite games, the game (book) restarts from the beginning every time. However, the information gathered by the player stays and new actions can be performed.


### Player Experience

The player will play as if he/she was reading a book. The player can only advance in the book their, actions are definitive and will advance them towards a certain ending.
